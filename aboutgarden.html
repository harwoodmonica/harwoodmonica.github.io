<h1>About the Poolesville Community Garden</h1>
<p> The Poolesville Community Garden project is a community-wide collaborative effort hosted by the Poolesville 
Presbyterian Church and facilitated by Poolesville Green. In the spring of 2013, church members decided to convert an 
empty lot on the church's property into a vegetable garden to benefit the entire community. The garden opened in May of 2014, 
and has proven to be an invaluable asset to the community as a center for agricultural education and a shared gardening space for 
local residents. In addition, the garden serves the community by supporting Poolesville&#8217;s commitment to its Sustainable Maryland Certification, 
preserving the integrity of local biodiversity with native trees, plants, and shrubs, and providing an affordable means of healthy food 
production for community residents. The garden also serves as a beautiful, park-like setting for the entire community to enjoy, spring through fall.</p>
